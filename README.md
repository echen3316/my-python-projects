# my-python-projects
These python projects demonstrate my work through the year, projects that I was happy and confident to show out!
1. 99bottles- This code is a reference to the song 99 bottles and goes down from 99 to 0, thanks to a string function.
-Key Functions: (String and String- Involves code repeating a boolean, where it lowers a number each time it goes through the loop, Metric Function, to measure a certain function if it was greater than or equal to a value)

2. Project Food- Code prompts different food items and generates a food similar to the request.
   Key Functions: (If Statements- as it goes down step by step through user input)
   
3. YAYYY: This code builds a picnic area using multiple cut define functions and turtle
   Key Functions: (Turtle- We used turtle and everything that's extensive from that category, as a drawing and coloring canvas)
   
4. Fortune Cookies: This code is a simulation where the user inputs what they want from a number generator, on what asian foods they want, using (strings, booleans, define functions)
   Key Functions -Arrays, BytesIO, if statements, loop statements- "while True", booleans, strings, imported time

5.iplaypokemonj: This project is a game simulation to pokemon, where user input is needed to evolve a spuirtle
   Key Functions- if statements, "global", strings, booleans(controls evolutions and levels), imported values
   
6. rockpaperscissors: This python function is a randomizer robot that uses the "random" function when playing rock, paper, scissors.
   Key Functions- Imported Values, global, loops, if statements, random
7. slotmachines: This python function is a casino system, a randomizer will determine your winnings.
   Key Functions- Imported time, imported random, global, if statements, loop and break functions
